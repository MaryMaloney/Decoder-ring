# Decoder-ring
This application allows the user to encode and decode messages using either the caesar shift, polybius square, or substitution cipher. If a positive shift value is given, the caesar shift shifts the characters of a message a certain number of characters to the right. If a negative shift value is given, it shifts the characters to the left. The polybius square translates characters into a number that correspondons to a position in a two dimensional array known as a polybius square. The substitution cipher provides an encoded or decoded message by exchanging letters in the English alphabet with a new alphabet provided by the user.
